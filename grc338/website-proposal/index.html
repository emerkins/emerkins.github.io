					<h1>About</h1>
				
					<p>The Safe Plate was created for people who can’t afford to “just try it and see.” For those who read every label, ask every question, and plan every meal carefully, because their health depends on it. We believe safety should never mean sacrificing flavor, variety, or convenience. That’s why every meal we prepare is crafted with intention, transparency, and strict safety protocols at every step. From ingredient sourcing to packaging, nothing is an afterthought. Our mission is simple: to give you back peace of mind at the table. Because food should bring comfort, connection, and nourishment, not stress. At The Safe Plate, safety is the standard. Delicious is just part of the deal.</p>
